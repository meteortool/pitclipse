      Meteor is a tool resulting from a master&apos;s degree research work
for the applied computing course at IPT (São Paulo Technological
Research Institute).
It works as a plugin for the Eclipse IDE designed to support
developers in validating the success of a test code refactoring.
To install Meteor, see the instructions below.
To make the project possible, a fork of the Pitclipse project
was made to make the necessary changes for the tool&apos;s functionality.
